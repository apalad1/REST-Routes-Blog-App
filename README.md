# REST-Routes-Blog-App
Code along from the udemy web developer bootcamp I've been studying. Was an introduction to basic routes like: index, new, create,  show, edit, delete

Like I said in the app.js, none of the routes are broken up since this was my first time going through the concept.

Used:
-mongodb
- node packages: (express, body-parser, mongoose, method-override, express-sanitizer)


HAS
- the functionality to retain information due to database
- create new posts
- update posts
- delete posts

DOESN'T HAVE

- register/login/logout
- meaning anyone that uses this can edit/delete/create any post
